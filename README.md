# Performance Testing with k6

When it comes to performance testing, JMeter has long been a popular choice. However, k6, an open-source load testing tool introduced in 2017, offers a compelling alternative with its efficiency and ease of use.

## Why k6?

- **Written in Go**: k6 is built on Go, which prioritizes performance, making it highly efficient.
- **Easy Load Generation**: A single instance of k6 can handle thousands of virtual users on a single machine, simplifying load distribution.
- **Protocol Support**: k6 supports various protocols including HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, WebSockets, gRPC, and SOAP/REST webservices.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To start using k6, install it based on your operating system:

- **Mac**: Use Homebrew with `brew install k6`.
- **Windows**: Utilize the Windows Package Manager with `winget install k6`.

For other installation options, refer to the [k6 downloads page](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation).

### Writing Your First k6 Load Test

1. **Set Up**: Install Visual Studio Code for creating JavaScript/TypeScript-based tests.
2. **Creating a Load Test**: Begin by writing a simple k6 load test.

```javascript
import http from "k6/http";

export default function () {
  http.get("https://test-api.k6.io/public/crocodiles/");
}
```

## Running the Test
Execute the test using the terminal command k6 
```javascript
run k6-loadTest.js.
```

## Enhancing Load Tests
- Adding Thresholds: Define acceptance criteria using thresholds to specify acceptable request durations or failure rates.
- Adding Virtual Users: Configure the number of virtual users (vus) and duration to apply load.
